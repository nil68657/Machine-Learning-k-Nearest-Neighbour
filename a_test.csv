"OXO Tot 4-Piece Feeding Set, Green",Meals can be quite stressful in our house but now they are a little less messy.  My daughter likes to throw things including her dishes.  With these she has a much harder time since the entire base is rubber.  The side lip around the plate that is removable helps keep her food in the plate and get it onto the spoon.Great dish set even though it's pricey.Highly recommend!,5
"Jeep Cherokee Sport Stroller, Brick Red",When shopping for an umbrella stroller we wanted something compact and sturdy. We also didn't want to spend a lot of money for a stroller our child will outgrow in about 30lbs or so. This stoller meets our expectations and the price is great. I have read complaints about not being able to lock the stroller but if you are standing behind it there is a small red latch next to the pocket that locks the stroller in place.,5
"Skip Hop Moby Bathtub Elbow Rest, Blue","Recently purchased this, so I've only used it a handful of times so far. Can't complain about much as of yet. It does the job. We've used it on the kitchen sink and on the bathtub so far. Easily switches between the two. The majority of the padding is on the top (for mom/dad's elbows) but the neoprene sides are also very handy for extra protection for baby's head/hands/feet/body in case of accidental contact with the edge of the sink/tub it covers.Haven't really used the zipper compartment. The rest has three suction cups to attach to the tub/sink walls (one on one side, two on the other). Dries out quickly (we toss it in the front loading washing machine on 'drain' and its done).Very pleased, will recommend to others.",4
Cloud b Mimicking Monkey,The &#34;white noise&#34; function on this thing is so quiet that we had to send it back.  My baby requires LOUD white noise to sleep through the night and this guy wasn't even close.,1
Evenflo Single Breast Pump,I used this product because my son would not latch and I had to pump.  This product works well for the price.  It may be a bit noisy but it works just fine.  I have had it for 3 months now and it is still giving the same resourcefulness as when I used it the first day.  I needed to express milk for my son and this product helps me to do that.,4
"Summer Infant Snuzzler, Ivory","Mt granddaughter always cried when we put her in the carseat,until we put this in they crying has stopped . It's soft and comfortable. I was sold when the crying stopped. Excellent product.",5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","This is the best bottles ever build.  My baby, (3 month old) is happy besides is BPA free..  I recommend it.",5
"Boppy Pillow with Brocade Slipcover, Black and White",So far I have only used this for feeding but it helps to provide support to my arms when feeding.  Cannot wait to start using it to prop up baby.,4
"Chicco Smart Support Backpack, Red","No problems with it.  Rugged construction.  The windshield is really great.  Very sturdy, and easy to put together. does an awesome job no matter what the terrain.",5
"BRICA UV Alert Window Shade, Gray","I was looking for shades for the back (side) windows in our Jeep and these are a great fit. My husband said they were very easy to install.  There is a button at the top to press for retracting the blinds. Couldn't be more easy and convenient. They look nice and neat, too.",5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Bottle Brush, Blue",I don't know why would it matter that a brush is made with BPA plastic unless you are planning on boiling it. But this product is great. It is lasting 6 months so far.,5
"Thermos Foogo Leak-Proof SS 7 Ounce Sippy Cup with Handles, Pink, 6 Months","For parents who are concerned about chemicals in what  has become traditional baby products, this is a great non-bpa replacement for the plastic sippy cup. My daughter is particularly fussy about the recipient she's drinking out of and I was very surprised she accepted this in no time, as I involved her in opening up the Amazon box and be surprised by what she got.The only slightly negative thing about it is that it often takes several attempts before you can properly fix the spout in the lid hole. Once it's done it's totally leak proof.",4
NTM-910YIC - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor,This monitor works beautifully. It is so clear that we can hear the baby breathing while he is sleeping. I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a good baby monitor.,5
Tobbles,"MY Grandson loves this toy when he is not playing with it  i am playing with it, colors are vibrant and it is quite amazing how they balance on each other  Another Pulu...Guess what NO Batteries either...",5
'The Insulated Sippy' by Eco Vessel Insulated Stainless Steel Sippy Cup - 10 Oz - Hudson Blue - 10 oz - Container,Pretty.  1 yr old has not gone for using this odd nipple as a sippy for longer than 20 seconds.  I'm sure he just needs to get used to it and our personal transition is going rocky because I introduced it after 9 months.,4
"Luvable Friends Flannel Fitted Crib Sheet, Yellow Circle",I love these sheets for our cold Michigan winter nights.  Great fit and soft too.  They hold up well after repeated washes.  Would recommend.,5
Beaba 3-Stage Baby Bottle Training Sippy Cup - Pink,"My daughter has loved this cup since we bought it over a year ago -- it's always been her favorite, first with the nipple, and now with the regular top.  Even though she can drink out of a normal cup by now (she's nearly two), she still prefers this one.  And if you put the lid on tightly it doesn't pop off.  They key (and this took me a while), is to make sure you press down firmly on the top and make sure it's down on all sides (this sounds more complicated than it is).  If you do that, no problems.  Promise -- ours has been dropped many times...  Also, it's dishwasher safe for real, unlike a lot of others that degrade over time.  This has gone through literally hundreds of times, and still looks brand new.  Totally worth the extra money -- you'll love it.",5
Hello Kitty Large Collage Pink Childs Backpack,This is perfect for any Hello Kitty fan.  She loves it!  It was delivered on time and in perfect condition.  It's a little bigger than I expected but she will grow into it.  It's great!,5
"JJ Cole Original Infant Bundleme, Snow","I was delighted to receive the bundle me for a baby gift but was quickly disappointed when I realized the car seat straps thread through the ""fleece.""  This can potentially cause problems with getting a snug fit and can increase compressibility in an accident. There should be nothing between your baby and the car seat except for a layer of clothing.  I liked the idea of having a built in blanket but did not want to compromise the safety of my child.After examining the Bundle Me I decided to ""cut out"" the back panel where the straps thread through.  This allowed me to place the cover in the seat without worrying about having to thread the straps through the thick fleece  Now, my baby is positioned directly on the carseat but is surrounded by the Bundle Me.  It truly is a perfect fit, the straps are not hindered by the bulky fleece and I am no longer concerned about compressiblity.It was an easy enough modification and I wish the manufacturer would adopt this change.",4
SOHO 4 in 1 Soft Kahki Diaper bag,"I loved the design, and I still do, but the size is weird, very square, and seems to be cheaply made.",2
"C.R. Gibson Loose-Leaf Memory Book, Baby Bots",This book is awesome! It has pages for everything u could possible want to record. I love the fact that u can add pages along the way and page protectors to put memorable items in.,5
"Delta 48 Piece Nursery Storage Set, Beige","Great starter set for a new baby's closet.  Hangers are the perfect size for baby clothes and the 3 small bins fit into the hanging organizer like drawers.  Color is neutral and great.  The dividers and stickers were kind of worthless in my set though.  Most of the stickers wouldn't peel off the sheets, so they ripped and had to go in the trash.  It didn't really matter though - the dividers just spin around the closet rod, they aren't weighted, so even if you manage to get the stickers onto them, chances are slim the label will actually be visible.  Not a big deal.  For the price, everything else was great!  If I need dividers I can pick those up elsewhere.  All in all this was a great purchase, and I'm pretty picky.",4
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","Fine when it works, which is for about 2 months.  I have gone through three of them, too bad they aren't more long lasting.  The sounds are pretty good, the nightlight is useful, and the projector works well mostly (hard to keep focused well).  But the killer issue is that it just stops working after 1-2 months.",1
Regalo 192-Inch Super Wide Gate and Play Yard,"I bought this pay yard for my four-month old puppy and I am very satisfied.  It's sturdy and safe.  I like the fact that it can be made into a circular play yard or protective gate.  It hasn't tipped over once, despite a 30 lb puppy jumping up and putting his paws on the top.  I especially like the gate latch and how it opens to the inside.  No bolting!  Definitely a quality purchase.  Arrived on time and great price!",5
"Mary Meyer Wubbanub Plush Pacifier, Cutsie Caterpillar","Our 6 month old loves her """"Wubbzy""""!  I would highly recommend it for any youngling who prefers a pacifier. It is nicely weighted so it sits on baby's chest and is easily accessible.",5
Playtex BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottle Newborn Starter Set (Packaging may vary),Our baby had terrible gas and reflux. These bottles helped reduce the air going to her belly. They have multiple parts but you get used to assembling and cleaning them quickly.,5
"Sassy Grow Up Cup No Spout, No Spill Design 12 oz - 18 Months","I ordered these cups to transition my son to a regular cup from a sippy cup.  They are colorful and they hold enough liquid to satisfy him.  I do have to say they do leak of you turn them upside down, but then again maybe I did not tighten it enough.  They are easy to clean and fun to drink out of.  My daughter who is 7 really enjoys them and they are fun enough that even I drink out of them!  For a set of two you will be pleased",5
Safety 1st Tubside Bath Seat,"There's another seller asking 35 or so for it, or you can check online auction places. This sellers price is completely insane and ticks me off. Freaking robbery, and you should be ashamed of yourself.The bathseat however, is great. It's most definitely not worth THIS sellers asking price. But it's worth it's ORIGINAL selling price which is between 20 and 30'ish.",5
"Sealy Natural Cotton Crib Mattress Pad, 52&quot; X 28&quot;","This mattress pad was exactly what I was looking for. It arrived on time and I was excited to give my son a softer place to sleep. After a wash, an air dry, and an air spin in the dryer it was nice and fluffy. The magic ended as soon I put it on the mattress. It was not a tight stretch at all but as I pulled it over the third corner, it ripped. The side stretchy material tore away from the topper. I thought at first I might be able to stitch it back together but the tear just keeps getting bigger. I assume since I already washed it, it is nonreturnable and we will have to find a different product. Bummer.",1
"aden + anais 2 Pack Muslin Burpy Bib, Princess Posie","These bibs are super soft and absorbent. They provide great coverage. I like that they use snaps instead of velcro. The snaps on one of my bibs broke, so I contacted the company and they sent me a replacement bib. Great customer service!",5
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock,"We put this over the baby's crib, filled it with toys, and put a video baby monitor in it too. I want to train him early that someone is always watching and listening to his conversations. Welcome to America, Baby.",5
"Safety 1st Sweet Wonder Play Yard, Cubes",Happy with the product. Durable and of better quality than others I've seen. Highly recommended.,4
Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo EZ Clean High Chair,My husband thought this was a well made high chair it was easy to put together because everything went it its respective place.  The straps and the seating are easy to adjust and my grandson loves it!,5
Philips AVENT Isis iQ Duo Twin Electronic Breast Pump,"After reading many reviews, I decided to purchase this pump instead of the medella pump in style.  I was a little unsure because I couldn't find as many reviews on the avent pump because it was fairly new.I am very happy with my decision.  I get 6-8 oz in only 10 minutes.  The bag is very roomy and looks great.  I thought it was a little pricy, but I purchased mine on ebay brand new in sealed box and saved over $100.Some cons are that you need to wash and sterilize the horn and attachments every time you pump, so I tried to purchase an extra set to rotate.  WOW EXPENSIVE!!!  It was going to cost me $130 for the extra set.  Almost half the price of the entire pump.  So I have been using the medella quick clean wipes to clean my pump parts at work.  They work out great!  Avent also needs to make a battery pack or car adaptor.  When you travel or for just a day trip, you must have access to electric!  I just took a weekend shopping trip and it was a big hassel to always find a place to plug the pump in.",5
"Dr. Brown's 4 oz Natural Flow Baby Bottle, 3 Pack",I was given one pack of these bottles at a gift at my shower. They looked really confusing to me but thought I would give them a try. My baby almost never had gas. They cut the air right out of the bottle and he loved the shape of the nipple. These are a must have especially with a colic or fussy baby!!,5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce",I like that the bottles are BPA Free - I feel good about using them to feed my baby.  But I don't like dealing with the extra vent parts - it's just more parts to wash.  I tried using the bottles without putting the vent in and the nipples just collapse - so you have to use the vents.  But overall I like these bottles.,3
Dream Baby Door Catches 2 pack,"Work well, and they are easy to install. Attractive looking. If I need more catches, these would be the ones that I would order. Price could be lower though",5
beginning... by Maclaren Connecting Massage Oil,Excellent but a little fragrant. Works great! And is perfect for baby massage. Bottle is easy to grip  And doesn't pour out too fast. Excellent,5
"Dr. Brown's Standard Dishwashing Basket, Polypropylene","So glad I bought this! It fits all of the pieces perfectly and gets them cleaner than the other baskets I've used. It hold parts for 3 bottles and takes up less room than other baskets while ensuring all of the parts are washed properly. I highly recommend buying this if you have Dr. Brown's bottles, as it makes washing them in the dishwasher much more convenient and does a much better job than other baskets (the straws don't hang down, the tops don't flip over, and nothing overlaps).",5
OsoCozy Better Fit Unbleached Prefolds (Infant 4x8x4 Fits 6-16 lbs.) - Dozen,"Excellant absorbency (you should boil them before use) and they have lasted through probably hundreds of washes.  They are soft for baby, too.",5
PumpEase Classic Collection hands-free pumping bra - Verry Cherry - M,"As a new mom I dreaded pumping each day... it just wasn't pleasant for me.  Buying this PumpEase bra made it much more bearable.  I don't even have to think about the pumping happening... I can instead use my free hands/free time to read my Kindle, return email, or just chill out.  Sizing chart was true to size.  I've been using it daily for over a month with no stretching and no complaints!",5
Colgate Mattress 13 x 27 x 2 Oval Replacement Mattress Pad,probably lucky they are out of stock on this item.  the mattress is a thin piece of foam covered by plastic - all for $48.00.  i expected a little more for my money.  really SAD!,1
"Kiddopotamus Dreamsie Sleeper with Sleeves Microfleece Small, Blue","This immediately became a favorite with my daughter.  She puts the baby in it every night, washes beautifully (every day).  Highly recommend this product.  Everything was shipped quickly and arrived in great condition.The only problem I had was, it did not come in pink in small thru the website.  This was for a first girl, but fortunately, no one minded it was blue because of the warmth and convenience each night.",5
"Boon Gnaw Multi-Purpose Teething Tether, Grape/Kiwi","It's ok by my judgement but my twins LOVE this. They fight for it. Even though you're supposed to put a biscuit or teether thing in the green netting portion, my twins like to bite on it just as is. It's a little dangerous when they fling it around since it's a bit long because it's reallymeant to be snapped onto something but my twins pull it right off when snapped onto their clothes.",3
Snug Square Play Mat (Cream-Espresso),"Most comfortable play mat for baby, even has space where I can lay and play. Very comfortable! Makes me want to fall asleep on the floor. I nominated this for a Cribbie. A must have for any baby from tummy time and beyond!",5
Long-Range Vibrating Baby Monitor,"I just wanted to recap what the ""toy enthusiast from MA"" said below:""I did however find a company that actually made me a new rechargable battery. The company is called Battery World ([...]) The battery was about $13.00 US and it worked great. So for all you Moms who love this monitor but need a battery here is your solution. ""We also own the original version of this monitor, the battery died after about 2 years of use, and we have ordered the replacement battery from Battery World - $15 US. Keep up the good work Battery World!",4
"Door Monkey, Childproof Door Lock &amp; Pinch Guard","This is an absolutely brilliant invention. It is by far the simplest and easiest-to-operate of any child-proofing door solution I've ever seen. No fiddling with doorknobs or intricate catches, and it doesn't leave any scratches or dents in the door or frame. And it's much, much less expensive than other solutions that allow for airflow.Place it out of the reach of infants and toddlers but within the reach of small children to allow the older kids to get in and out without risking the baby falling down the stairs or smashing fingers in the doorjamb. It's also great for keeping the cat out of the bedroom and guest room&#8212;or in the room with the cat tree if we have workers coming in and out of the house over an extended period.As a super-awesome bonus, it also allows for decent airflow.Children with separation anxiety may be comforted by being able to see their parents through the modest gap.Seriously, the inventor deserves a medal for this.",5
"Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Projection Mobile, Precious Planet",I have trouble putting my baby to sleep every night without rocking her in my arms for at least half an hour. Until I purchased this product when my baby girl was 3 months old and have been using it ever since. We just hang it on the crib and turn the mobile projector on every night. The first 10 - 15 minutes she would be talking to the animals until she gets tired and falls asleep by herself. i strongly recommend this product to anyone. This product is an excellent purchase! It helps your baby train to sleep by herself. One suggestion for parents who would purchase this product is when you hang it on the crib dont put your baby directly under the projector. Place it where the baby would be looking down a little bit because it somehow forces her eyes to close and make her fall asleep  faster.,5
CNC-KE Taby Tray White,"The car tray is great.  My grandson loves it.  It allows him to drive his cars while we are traveling.  He loves the cupholder, too.  I like the ridge around the edges that keep things from rolling off the trays.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",This is a great litle learning toy and night light. The display of the moon and constellations on the ceiling was very clear. We gave it to a 4 year old and she was delighted. She gave us a big smile big hugs.,5
"Safety 1st Alpha Elite 65 Infant Car Seat, Rachel","This is a great car seat for the baby. It is set up so as your child grows, it accommodates for his/her size. The material is top notch in quality. I couldn't find any flaws in it. The cushioning is comfortable with sufficient padding. It also fit easily into the van as well as the sedan. I think this is a great product and I give it five stars.",5
"NUK Ultra Thin Breast Pads, Pack of 2, White, 120-Count",I bought these because they were cheaper then the pads I normally buy. I regret not spending the extra $2! I woke up this morning with a soaked Tshirt because they had leaked. I'm going to stick with my normal brand.,1
Boon Flair Harness/Buckle,Exactly what I needed. I wanted light nuetral 5 pt. harness straps to attach to a wooden high chair I'd salvaged from a thrift store. These do the trick nicely and work well.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My toddler LOVES his turtle! It's a huge comfort for him while falling asleep. It's especially great because it turns off on its own after a while, so he doesn't require a night light all night long. Great product! Super bright!",5
"Regalo Maxi Super Wide Walk Thru Gate, White",This lasted outside through 4 NE winters.  I just replaced with same brand/type of gate. Use to keep Min-Pin in either front or back yard.  He does not jump on it.  Not the strongest gate for a small child or a dog that would try to jump against it.  But is just what we needed and held up outside longer than we thought it would!  I recommend that Amazon sell the extensions for this gate also.,5
"Munchkin 12 Ounce Mighty Grip Toddler Sports Bottle, Colors May Vary",Does not spill. It is a little hard for my toddlers to actually suck the water out but they are getting the hang of it.,4
"American Baby Company 3-Piece Portable/Mini Crib Set with Large Espresso Dot, Blue","Keeping in mind I haven't washed this yet..This set is so soft and way cuter than it looks online. I noticed some fuzz (from the blue parts) hanging on to the brown parts of this, but a swipe of the hand takes it off quickly.Everything fits, but the fitted sheet sides could fit better. I have a mattress that is less than 3 inches wide and the sides creep up a tad, though it's not bad enough to worry about. I also thought it was strange that the ties on the bumpe aren't where the four corners are but instead end up a rail or two after the corners, but maybe that's just installer error (it's been awhile since I've had cause to put a bumper on a crib!)Considering how difficult it is to find a bedding set for a mini crib, I would gladly recommend this to anyone looking for such an item. I would probably purchase this for a regular crib if they came in that size if that says anything!",4
"Fisher-Price Potty Training, Froggy","It is such a cute potty.  But for a boy who has that certain type of equipment, it doesn't protect your floors or walls.  Definitely needs a front cup for a boy.  But I also have a girl, so works nice for her.  Just wish it could accomodate me for a boy.  But it is cute  just not efficient.",3
"green sprouts Stacking Cup Set, Colors may vary",Our LO loves these a lot!!  They go with us everywhere as a must have toy. She loves to take the apart and chew on them too.  These can be used in the water which is a great use too.,5
"OXO Perfect Pull Wipes Dispenser, Pink","This wipes dispenser is the cats pajamas!!!  Works great, there is an internal weight that keeps the wipes from bunching up and we only get one wipe at a time!!!  This is our 5th child and don't know how we got by without this all of these years,this thing is a game changer.  The lid has a good quality rubber seal that keeps the wipes moist and they never dry out.  The lid is spring loaded and opens with just a press of the lid keeping your other hand free which is great for those times when changing diapers is like trying to subdue an angry Wildebeast  Very nice product,HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",5
"The First Years Babypro Quick Serve Bottle Warmer, Colors May Vary","When I first bought this, over a year ago, I was hesitant about the price - it being so low compared to other brands. Rest assured, this is all you will need! My finicky baby had to have his warm Alimentum. This bottle warmer is sooo quick and easy, I could put the water up to the predetermined line of the measurer(that comes with) poor it in and left it alone. It was ready within a minute and after a few shakes, it was the perfect temperature. This is also helpful for warming up baby food jars (Comes with a special attachment just for that purpose) The warmer was dropped twice on the floor so it can defently take a beating! Outside is easy to clean (the water deposits on the warmer - not so much) All in all It did the job for my little boy. And for $16 GET IT! And Get one for the Grandparents! Don't spend $30 on a bigger and bulker item that will do the same thing!",5
GEENNY Musical Mobile For All Star Sports CRIB BEDDING SET,It was a joy to see my son entertained by this mobile. All little boys love sports and this was just perfect for him.,5
Boxy Backpack Diaper Bag - Rhone Blooms,"I purchased this bag when I had my 3rd, after using boy diaper bags I wanted something more feminine. Def had to be a backpack as I had a 4 year old, 2 year old and newborn. I bought the stroller clips to use on our bugaboo and they work fine, just wish it was standard on the bag like some of the other brands of diaper bags. I LOVED having the zip out diaper changing station-absolutely a lifesaver for anywhere diaper changes. Liked the side pockets for water bottles and sippy cups/bottles, but sometimes they would fall out if I bent over (maybe needs a drawstring closure??). I used the bag both ways (backpack and messenger style) and I prefer the backpack.  It just seemed to wide to use as a messenger back IMO. Also wish there was a top handle and padded shoulder straps. On the plus side the material is completely wipeable and durable...the embroidery stitching is NOT. mine has snagged :(  The color on this particular print is not overly pink but definitely feminine with the soft pink flowers and interior. There is the removeable zip pocket in the inside for mommy stuff and two interior pockets....lacking IMO, the bag needs more. And the bag never has felt like it can carry everything I want to take, I'm usually left deciding on what to pack and leaving some stuff behind because it won't fit.  I'm going to try the Mrs. Smith's bag and we'll see if I end up selling my PPB!",4
"Harmony Kids Standard Rocker, Hot Pink",This is a big hit at our house.  This was a gift for my 18 month old on Christmas morning.  She was so excited to see her own sized chair and has sat in it every day for almost a year.  It's still a good size for her!,5
MAM Silicone Ulti 2pk Pacifier in Box Assortment,"I ordered these to have some variety in the pacifiers that my daughter has. The pacifiers that arrived are adorable, but there is a problem. The packaging says MAM by Sassy, but it does not say BPA free. I called MAM Baby as well as Sassy and neither company could verify whether or not the pacifiers are BPA free. Sadly, back they go.",1
Mommy's Helper Cushie Traveler,"My 3 year old is just finishing being potty trained.  I tried the flat foldable toilet seat for travel and she hated the &#34;pinch&#34; and wanted padding.  This seat is very portable, fits nicely in my diaper bag, and she has no problem using it out.  It folds to about 7inches long by 4 inches thick.",5
"Recaro Vivo High Back Booster Car Seat, Midnight Desert Micofiber","My almost 4 year old really likes this seat, as do I.  It is very heavy, much more substantial than some of the other brands I have looked at.  The only complaint I have is the fabric it is covered in is hot and I am a little concerned about how it will clean. Overall, a great seat.",4
"Philips Avent 10 Pack BPA Free Breast Milk Storage Starter Set, Clear, 6 Ounce","I intended to use these for breast milk storage, but since BF didn't work out for me, they were stuck in the closet unopened. Now that my baby is weaning, I decided to give these a try for homemade food storage. They're excellent! They hold enough food, seals well in the freezer, pops out without any effort and I know exactly how much I'm feeding her. I seriously love them! I can make big patches of food, immediately freeze them. To defrost, I run them in water for a few seconds, open the lid and the contents slip right out to a bowl to heat up. Easy peasy, no spills and no messing with cling wrap! Best part is they're BPA free.",5
"Jeep Stroller Parasol, Black","Brakes easily, however a good size to use with a small stroller or carseat .  Black but looks cute for a girl",1
MDR Store Faux Leather Skull Clutch PU Purse Rings Duster Knuckle Style Party Bag,"this bag is sick, sick, sick!  mad compliments!  quality of skulls is impressive & bag looks like real leather.  so hot!  cute!  sick!!!!",5
"Baby Buddy Secure-A-Toy, Navy/Red","These are very handy to have around, secures toys or handled cups to the stroller. One did start to fray at the end after only a few weeks of use.",5
Evenflo Crosstown Soft Portable Travel Gate,"My wife purchased this gate for then entry way between our living room and dining room.  I found it fairly easy to operate, but the clasps that hold the gate apart inside the fabric failed sending my twin daughter and son head first into the dining room.  The simple truth is that this item should be recalled.  It is substandard construction and will result in injury to you or your child.  If I could figure out how to do it, I would contact the company and ship the piece of junk back to them at my expense.",1
Yummi Pouch (Set of 6),"Im a mom of 3.  a daughter, 3yo and twin boys 18mo.  life is crazy!  to say the least.  and I hate messes, which is inevitable.  The reusable pouches have become an everyday item, a must for us!  breakfast, or snacks.... I mash up a smoothie and they chug it down, with no mess. I had been using the little green pouch and the infantino diposable and silicone ones,but after around a few months the little green ones didn't clean up well.  The fact that they were a very stiff material, made it difficult to get in the spout area or to the bottom creases, where food gets trapped.  The infantino ones were nice but you threw them out, and their silicone reusable ones, were hard for the little ones to suck or squeeze them to get everything out.  I just received the Yummi brand ones in the mail, and I love the feel.  they are similar to the disposable ones so easier to clean, and easier to get out.  So far, I have no complaints but Ive only had them for a few days, so that's why I only gave 4 outa 5 stars.  Oh and I ordered on their website and received them within 4 days!  love that.",4
Sound N Lights Monitor with Dual Receivers,"This monitor is great for our house and we live near large power lines.  No static at our house but when we went to visit relatives in NV, lots of static.... so, I recommend that you try it out first.  Have had it on 24hrs a day for 2 months and no problems at our house!",5
Munchkin Steam Guard Microwave Sterilizer,I had purchased this Munchkin Steam Guard Microwave Sterilizer to be delivered to my parents house to use while home for the holidays.  I feel condensation is leaking on the outside.  Overall works well and I love the fact since I have a high watt microwave I only need to microwave it for 2 minutes.Given the option between the Advent and the Munchkin I feel the Advent is better quality sterilizer but it is still an overall good option for the price.,4
"Graco Pack 'n Play Sheet, Grey","The Pack n Play sheet is neither quilted, nor Tarragon. It is grey. The description and price do not match the item.",1
"Bunnies by the Bay Buddy Blanket, Skipit","Our daughter loves her """"la la"""" she won't sleep without it.  We now own three of these and have them in a rotation for getting washed.  The bunny looks a little worn but it does get washed every few days. The pink blanket portion has stayed soft on both sides.  We have bought several bunnies as gifts as well.  Highly recommed.",5
"Summer Infant Plush Pals Changing Pad Cover, Green/Brown (Monkey)","it is beutifull and soft, color it is ok, the qulity it is so high, i love it, i love it, and it is perfect size for the chngid pad",5
Jolly Jumper Bath Tub Toy Bag,"I purchased this item thinking it could hold a few small tub toys. It does that if it you like them on the floor.  The suctions haven't worked properly since day one. My shower tile walls are clean. It """"sucks"""" when you get scared half to death wondering what that loud crash was in your tub when it falls after you are already out of there.",1
"Fuzzibunz One Size Diaper White, 7-35 Pounds","I bought this diaper because our OverNite Disposable Diapers were still leaking and baby boy was waking up cold and wet :o(. We tried doubling up the disposables and that didn't work. Finally a Friend tipped me off to buying a diaper like this to cover over the disposable and it works! Early this AM baby boy took a big poo in his disposable which leaked over onto the Fuzzy Bunz and I was extremely impressed how well and easily the Poo washed off the extremely super soft, fuzzy FuzzyBunz. Wow! Also, even with the double up baby boy  seems comfortable in this diaper. The adjustments are very good.",5
"AM PM Kids! Reversible Placemat/Chalkboard, Hoot Owls","Got it for my granddaughter, she's two years, and still impatient for her meals.  This keeps her occupied while waiting. Only bad thing is, not all chalk will work on it, I guess just the chalk that comes with it, not good when you lose the chalk, or throw out pieces when they break. Have to find out what kind of chalk it is, and where to get it.",4
"Pressions Handprint and Footprint Kit, Honey","We did impressions of our 5 month old and after many many many (~30) tries, the results came out great!  You just need to exercise patience and know that it will ALL be worth it in the end when you have this wonderful keepsake.  We watched the online video available on the Pressions website first and took their suggestion to do one foot imprint at a time.  I loved that these are 3D and are raised so you can see all the details, unlike the other kits out there that are recessed IN. Also, I really don't like the thought of the ink kits, even the invisible ones.  Just because you don't see the ink on her hands and feet doesn't mean it's all gone!  This kit is a bit expensive, but when my little girl is all grown up, I will not miss the $45 I spent and will just be happy to have a memory of the time she and her feet were so tiny.  I just wish I had gotten this kit when she was younger!I agree with some of the other reviewers that this is a 2-person job and that if your baby is still young, doing her footprints intead of handprints will be easier.The prints are made by pressing your baby's foot into slightly wet sand.  If the print doesn't come out right, just smooth out and try again. Once you are happy with the result, you pour some quick drying Plaster of Paris into the mold and let sit for a few hours. Once dry, you turn the whole thing upside down and all the sand will fall out except the grains stuck onto the plaster.  I took a small art paintbrush and lightly swept more of the sand away to better show some of the details and plan to buy some sort of clear protective coating to apply on top.Just remember to BE PATIENT (and make sure that your husband is, too) and don't settle for a print you're not happy with.  That is the beauty of this kit; you can try and try again!  It will all be worth it!",5
"Cosco Juvenile Funsport Play Yard, Kontiki","A little tricky (not difficult) to dismantle, but otherwise a great, affordable option for occasional use. I found instructions on how to take it down on YouTube.",4
Playtex 2 Pack VentAire Silicone Slow Flow Nipple,"We have slow flow nipples but these are just bad, might try to make the hole a little bigger to help it along.  Drips without any sucking occurring.Believe the issue is the baby isn't sucking properly on them to get anything out?  Child can handle 3 other types of nipples fine...",2
"Joovy Room&sup2; Portable Playard, Red","I have absolutely no idea why I never thought to send this back, or to call customer service about the horrible, horrible smell of this play yard, but I didn't. The smell has never gone away, and we have had this play yard for over a year. So to any of you who have one and think that the smell will probably just dissipate, IT WILL NOT. I'm very concerned about it now that I've discovered some of these arrive with no smell. I think I just thought that all play yards must smell, and generally assumed it would go away eventually, but it never has. The major question is: WHAT unnatural thing was used in the manufacture of *a place for babies to sleep* that would STILL smell this horrid after over a year of ownership? I will be calling them tomorrow and will update this review with their response.In terms of general quality, it's incredibly well made and very solid.  Maybe because it's so solid, it's very heavy.  You could see that as a positive or negative depending on whether you leave it set up in a room or pack it up and transport it often.  The sheet that comes with it is really soft, but white--not the best color for a playpen floor, really, but that's a minor complaint.  The smell has me worried, and that's not a good thing.  We parents have enough to worry about without adding this sort of thing to the mix!",2
"Jeep Wrangler Twin Sport All-Weather Stroller, Heat","I thought I had read enough reviews but apparently not.  Nice enough barebones stroller but doesn't fit through the doorways in my house leaving me to collapse it for storage which is sometime a pain.  My only other complaint is that there is only a lap belt and my 11 month old can bend forward practically out of the stroller.  So overall it's okay, not totally what I expected.",3
Meeno Baby Cool Me Seat Liner Stroller - Baby Blue,"works amazing on our City Select stroller, especially in the AZ heat!",5
"Munchkin Easy-Close Metal Gate, White","Bought this to keep the dog out of the baby's room.  Fits in a 30&#34; door frame and works well.  The top closure piece (that you can operate with 1 hand) was a little scuffed, but it doesn't interfere at all with its operation.  I (small female) can easily open this gate with one hand while holding the baby.  You will need to push the button on the top, as well as pull up the handle on the underside of the operator.  It's very easy.  I can do it with 2 fingers and a thumb.This gate also has a stopper on the bottom that allows you to either have it open only one direction, or swing freely in both directions.  It does not automatically close on its own.  And I do have to push it to close it (to make it latch by itself) or manually latch it behind me.I will definitely buy this again and am thinking about it to put in the bathroom to keep the dog out (although the opening is 55&#34; and I don't think that this one goes that far.)",5
Sunshine Kids Ultra Mat - Gray,This mat is perfect to protect your vehicle seats!  We have a suburban-so they are larger seats and it covers the whole seat and has a good size pocket in the front to store items.  I would recommend this item to save your vehicle seats!!,5
"Arm &amp; Hammer Secure Comfort Potty Seat, Colors May Vary",We have two of these - they're great. I don't care about the little arm and hammer thing.. but it's nice that there's no weird padding or whatever to get pee in it. Just sleek and wipeable.,5
"Britax Boulevard 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat Seat, Onyx",Be aware that the item is really a different color than what it looks like online. It looks blue online but is really different shades of purple with pink edging.,3
"North States Supergate Slide-Step and Lock Open Gate, Burnished Steel","Bought three gates from three different brands. By far it&#34;s the best, although cheaper than the other one I got",5
Plush Penguin Hat With Long Paws,"Bought this for my 10 yr. old granddaughter who adores penguins.  It is so cute, sturdy, and well-made. I can wear it myself, including the mittens!  She is nearly as tall as me, and a little crazy lol and I know it will be one of her favorite Christmas gifts. It's warm, too, which really makes it outerwear, as well something to play with.",5
Eddie Bauer Sport Pack Diaper Bag,"I thought that this Eddie Bauer diaper back pack would be the answer to my problems.  I need to have ""free - hands"" to take care of baby Melody, but just weeks after I purchased this item, the lining started to come out (just like the other reviews).  I am totally disgusted with it.  At first I loved it because it has front compartments for my things and a back compartment for all of Melody's things, but now with the lining falling out it is not as good as it originally seemed.",1
"Munchkin SpongeBob SquarePants Click Lock Insulated Straw Cup, Colors May Vary, 9 Ounce","My nephew was extremely tickled and carries it  around everywhere.He is a spongebob over the top, totally focused funatic.",5
"Disney 4 Piece Toddler Bedding Set, Taking The Race",Omg when I received this eventhough I was pissed off at fed ex that carrier sucks.. anyways good quality my son loved it was jumping up and down.. such a beauty... Also got it at a 50%off.... I'm in love with amazon good job....!!!,5
Fresh Baby So Easy Silicone Food Tray,"Prior to getting this food tray, I'd been using regular ice-cube trays.  Effective, cheap, and a pain in the tail to get the cubes out.  I would need to let the tray warm up a little bit, then twist and bash for a good 5 minutes to get all of the cubes out.  The flexible silicone allows me to pop out the cubes quickly and easily.  The 8 -1oz squares allows me to easily freeze one cup of food at a time.  The silicone cleans very easily, which I love.  My one minor negative is that, since the silicone is soft and flexible, it can be bit difficult to tap the whole tray againt the counter to get thicker purees to settle in the blocks, but that is easily outweighed by the positives.",5
"Stork Craft Beatrice 4 Drawer Chest, White",We got this dresser to match the crib we bought elsewhere.  The dresser matches the espresso color of the crib.  The only thing was that one of the cam lock pieces was damaged and there were not any extra in the container so there is one place on the dresser that is not locked together correctly.  Other than that i am happy with it.,4
"Bella Tunno Happy Knees Protective Pads, Tutti Fruitti Blue",Not a bad product. Just too tight on my sons legs,3
